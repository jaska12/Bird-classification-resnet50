# 🐦 Bird Species Classification using ResNet50 (CUB-200-2011)

This project focuses on classifying bird species using the **CUB-200-2011 dataset** and a **fine-tuned ResNet50 deep learning model**.  
The model takes a bird image as input and predicts the most likely species.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Train a CNN model that can classify bird images into 200 species
- Fine-tune **ResNet50** for better feature extraction
- Visualize model attention using **Grad-CAM**
- Evaluate model performance using **Confusion Matrix**
- Explore potential deployment options for real usage
